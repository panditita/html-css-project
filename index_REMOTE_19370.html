						<blockquote> "One can perfectly well philosophize while cooking supper." <br> Sor Juana Ines de la Cruz </blockquote>

						<p class="intro-lead">Born circa November 12, 1651, in San Miguel Nepantla, Tepetlixpa, Mexico, Juana Ines de la Cruz's intelligence and scholarship
						became known throughout the country during her teen years. She began her life as a nun in 1667 so that she could study
						at will. After taking her vows, Sor Juana read tirelessly and wrote plays and poetry, often challenging societal values
						and becoming an early proponent of women's rights. Sor Juana is heralded for her Respuesta a Sor Filotea, which defends
						women's rights to educational access, and is credited as the first published feminist of the New World. She died in
						Mexico in 1695.
